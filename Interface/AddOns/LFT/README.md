_Note: addon communications are made in LFT chat channel, don't manually leave or check it in your main chat frame, its very spammy!_<Br>

## Known bugs ##
Addon textures don't load or just load a white texture: type `/run ReloadUI()`<br>
Chat channels order messed up: type `/leave LFT` (or any channel that's not in his place) and relog<br>
