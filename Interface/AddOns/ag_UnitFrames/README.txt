-long name support changed to long text support, now the function is working with "NameLabel", "HealthText", "ManaText" and "ClassText". The way to make a layout support this is the same as it was before with NameLabel.
-Made an option to disable the config menu that pops up when you click a frame, while holding ctrl, or alt.
-Made comments to highlight those parts that I wrote, or changed so far

-Too long names on certain layouts overlaped the HP, making it unreadable. I made an option to make long texts smaller. You have to enable Dynamic name size in the options to activate it, and have a layout, that supports it.
-To make a layout support the function, you have to add two variables:'longText', and 'longTextFontSize' to the NameLabel. The font size of the name will be set to the value of 'longTextFontSize', if the name is longer or equal of the value of 'longText'
